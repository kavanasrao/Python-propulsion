## Loops 

Loops are control flow statement in python that repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specific condition is true 

Two Types of Loops 
- for Loop
- while Loop

## For Loop :

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence 

example :

                fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
                for X in fruits :
                    print(X)



## range() function 

The loop through a set of code a specified number of times.
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

                example :

                for X in range(1,10,2):
                    print(X)


here,
 starting index = 1
 end_index = 10 but value is not included 
 step(increment) = 2
