# while Loop :

With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

first it will check the condition then enter to the loop 

**NOTE : 'i' should increment or else the loop will continue forever**


                example:

                age = 4
                while age < 16 :
                    print("school")
                    i+=1

<hr>

# break :

with the break statement, loop can be stop even if the while condition is true 

                i = 1
                while i < 6 :
                    print(i)

                    if i == 3 :
                        break

                    i += 1


# Continue :

Continue statement help to skip the current iteration and continue with next 

                i = 1
                while i < 7 :
                    print(i)

                    if i == 3 :
                        continue 
                    
                    i += 1
