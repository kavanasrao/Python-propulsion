# BOOLEAN VALUES

"In programming, we often need to determine whether an expression is 
True or False, such as when we compare two values to check if a condition is met
 suppose if,
                
                 a = 10
                 b = 20 
                 a < b
                 print(a < b)
                 # outPut ~ True
                 # comparing the value of a and b,
                 # b is greater than a
