# **Python**

### What is Python?
python is a programming language. It was created by Guido Van Rossum, 
and released in 1991.

**Used for:**
- web development
- software development
- connect to database systems. It can read and modify database
- handle Big data and perform complex mathematics
- System scripting

### Why Python ?
- Python supports all platforms
- Simple syntax similar to the English
- syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines
- Interpreter System means code can be executed as soon as it is written
    means prototyping can be very quick
<hr>

### What is REPL ?
REPL Stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop, and it is an interactive programming
environment. REPL allows to write and execute Python code line by line, interactively
It is one of the easiest ways to experiment with Python code snippets and test ideas quickly

<hr>

### How REPL Works ?
Read : Takes the User input
Eval : Evaluates(execute) the input code
Print : print Result
Loop : Repeats the process for the next input

<hr>

### How to Access REPL ?
- open a terminal or Command prompt
- Type Python or Python3 >> enter
- get python prompt (>>>), indicating REPL is ready to accept input

**Example**

                >>> "Hello, " + "World!"
                >>> 'Hello, World!'

**Enhanced REPLs**
- IPython
- Jupyter Notebook

## **Syntax**
**Execute Python Syntax**
Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line or by Creating a python file on the server(Vs code), Using the .py file extension, and running in Command Line.

                C:\User\your Name>python myfile.py


## **Python Indentation**
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Indentation in python is very important.
It uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
                
                if 5 > 2:
                    print("Five is greater than two")

Syntax Error:

                if 5 > 2:
                print("Five is greater than Two")

Same number of spaces in the same block of code, Otherwise Python will give an error.


## **Comments**

- Comments can be used to explain Python code.
- Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
- Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
- Python as Commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a '#', and Python will render the rest of the line as comment, multi line comments enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''')  """ Comment """.
