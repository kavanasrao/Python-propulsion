# Python Operators 

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values 

## Python divides the operators in the following groups :

- Arithmetic Operators 
- Assignment Operators 
- Comparison Operators 
- Logical Operators 
- Identity Operators 
- Membership Operators
- Bitwise Operators

## Arithmetic Operators :

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations

-   '+'   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Addition
-   '-'    &nbsp;&nbsp; Subtraction
-   '*'    &nbsp;&nbsp; Multiplication
-   '/'     &nbsp;&nbsp; Division
-   '%'    &nbsp;&nbsp; Modulus
-   '**'   &nbsp;&nbsp; Exponentiation
-   '//'   &nbsp;&nbsp; Floor Division

<hr>

## Assignment Operators :

-   '='    &nbsp;&nbsp;   Assigns the  value to variables
-   '+='   &nbsp;&nbsp;   Increment the value and assign the value
-   '-='  &nbsp;&nbsp;    Decrement the value and assign the value 

<hr>

## Comparison Operators :
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

-  &nbsp;  '==' &nbsp;&nbsp; Equal
-  &nbsp;  '!=' &nbsp;&nbsp; Not Equal
-  &nbsp;  '>'  &nbsp;&nbsp; Greater than
-  &nbsp;  '<'  &nbsp;&nbsp; Less than
-  &nbsp;  '>=' &nbsp;&nbsp; Greater then or equal to
-  &nbsp;  '<=' &nbsp;&nbsp; Less than or Equal to

## Logical Operators :

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

-  &nbsp;   and  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Returns True if both statements are true
- &nbsp;  or &nbsp;&nbsp;   Returns True if one of the statements is true
- &nbsp; not &nbsp;&nbsp;  Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true


<hr>

## Identity Operators :

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location

- &nbsp; is &nbsp;&nbsp;  Returns True if both variables are the same object 

- &nbsp; is not &nbsp;&nbsp; Returns True if both variables are not same object

<hr>

## Membership Operators :

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object 

- &nbsp; in &nbsp;&nbsp; Returns true if a sequence with the specified value is present inn the object 

- &nbsp; not in &nbsp;&nbsp; Returns True if a Sequence with the specified value is not present in the object 


<hr>

## Operator Precedence :
 Operator precedence describe the order in which operations are performed

Operator &nbsp;&nbsp;  Associativity 

1. Parentheses   &nbsp;&nbsp;   Left to right
	
2. Subscription, slicing  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Left to right


3. Await expression  &nbsp;&nbsp;  N/A

4. Exponentiation  &nbsp;&nbsp; Right to left

5. Positive, negative, bitwise NOT  &nbsp;&nbsp; Right to left 

6. Multiplication, matrix, division, floor division, remainder   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; left to right 

7. Addition and subtraction  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Left to Right 

8. Shifts   &nbsp;&nbsp; Left to Right 

9. Bitwise AND   &nbsp;&nbsp; Left to Right 
	
10. Bitwise XOR &nbsp;&nbsp; Left to Right 
	
11. Bitwise OR  &nbsp;&nbsp; Left to Right 
	
12. Comparisons, membership tests, identity tests   &nbsp;&nbsp; Left to Right 
	
13. Boolean NOT  &nbsp;&nbsp; Right to Left  

14. Boolean AND &nbsp;&nbsp; Left to Right 

15. Boolean OR  &nbsp;&nbsp; Left to Right 

16. Conditional expression &nbsp;&nbsp; Right to Left 
	
17. Lambda expression   &nbsp;&nbsp; N/A

18. Assignment expression    &nbsp;&nbsp; Right to Left 

**NOTE** ~ Associativity : If an Expression contains two or more operators with the same precedence then Operator Associativity is used to determine. 
*It can be either <strong>L</strong>eft to <b>R</b>ight or from <b>L</b>eft to <b>R</b>ight
